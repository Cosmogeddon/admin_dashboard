I didn't think this would be hard, but it proved otherwise.

I had difficulty with icons and ended up copying svg links and placig them in the nav list.

Another difficulty was the freaking announcements and trending.
The "Your projects" section was easy as could be in comparison.

One of my biggest concerns here was my target fixing rather than having a dynamically responsive website. It feels like ductt tape rather than a well-built site.
